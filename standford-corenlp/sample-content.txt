Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, is a revered figure in Hindu mythology. His life is depicted in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana.

Rama, born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya, was an embodiment of virtue and righteousness. His early years were marked by his marriage to Princess Sita after stringing the divine bow of Lord Shiva, a task only he could accomplish.
