Lord Rama, the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu, is a revered figure in Hindu mythology. His life is depicted in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana.

Rama, born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya, was an embodiment of virtue and righteousness. His early years were marked by his marriage to Princess Sita after stringing the divine bow of Lord Shiva, a task only he could accomplish.

However, Rama's joy was short-lived. His father, influenced by a promise made to his second wife, Queen Kaikeyi, was compelled to send Rama into exile for fourteen years. Devoted to duty, Rama accepted the exile without hesitation.

Accompanied by his devoted wife Sita and loyal brother Lakshmana, Rama embraced a simple life in the forest. During their exile, the demoness Surpanakha, enamored by Rama, approached him. When he politely declined her advances, she attacked Sita in jealousy. Lakshmana, in defense, cut off Surpanakha's nose, sparking a chain of events.

The demon king Ravana, enticed by Sita's beauty, kidnapped her and took her to his kingdom of Lanka. Rama, aided by an army of monkeys led by the devoted Hanuman, embarked on a perilous journey to rescue his beloved wife.

The epic culminated in the great battle of Lanka, where Rama, armed with his divine bow and arrow, confronted Ravana. In a fierce battle, Rama defeated the demon king and rescued Sita, upholding dharma and righteousness.

Rama's return to Ayodhya was celebrated with grandeur, marking the festival of Diwali. His reign as a just and benevolent king earned him the title of "Maryada Purushottam" â€“ the perfect man.

Lord Rama's life serves as a timeless example of unwavering devotion to duty, righteousness, and the triumph of good over evil. His legacy continues to inspire millions, and his story is cherished as a guiding light in the path of virtue.
